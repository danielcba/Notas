The Geolocation to CSV/KML system is a specialized utility for converting IP addresses into geographical coordinates and location metadata. This Python-based tool processes lists of IP addresses, queries the ipinfo API to retrieve geolocation data, and exports the results in both CSV format (for data analysis) and KML format (for visualization in mapping software such as Google Earth).

For installation instructions and requirements, see Installation and Requirements. For licensing information, refer to License Information.
System Purpose

The geolocation_to_csv_kml repository serves three main purposes:

    IP Geolocation: Determine the geographical location of IPv4 addresses using the ipinfo service
    Data Export: Output geolocation data in structured formats for analysis (CSV) and visualization (KML)
    Batch Processing: Handle multiple IP addresses efficiently with support for incremental updates

Core Components

The system is comprised of the following key components:

    Input File: geo.csv containing IP addresses to be geolocated
    Main Script: geolocation_to_csv_kml.py that processes IP addresses and generates outputs
    External API: ipinfo service that provides geolocation data
    Output Files:
        ipinfo_resultados.csv: Structured data in tabular format
        resultados.kml: Geographic visualization data compatible with mapping tools

Sources:
README.md26-30

README-EN.md26-30
Libraries and Dependencies

The script relies on three main Python libraries:
Library	Purpose
pandas	Data manipulation and CSV handling
ipinfo	Interface to the ipinfo API service
simplekml	Generation of KML files for geographic visualization

Processing Steps

    Input Processing: The script reads IP addresses from geo.csv using pandas
    API Querying: Each IP address is sent to the ipinfo API to retrieve location data
    Data Transformation: The API responses are normalized into structured data
    Output Generation:
        CSV output contains detailed fields (city, region, country, coordinates, ASN)
        KML output contains placemarks with geographic coordinates
    Incremental Updates: If output files already exist, new data is appended and duplicates are removed

Example Input/Output

Sample Input (geo.csv):

direcciones
8.8.8.8
1.1.1.1

Sample Output (ipinfo_resultados.csv):

Ciudad,Región,País,Latitud,Longitud,ASN,Direccion_ip
Mountain View,California,US,37.386,-122.084,AS15169 Google LLC,8.8.8.8
Sydney,Nueva Gales del Sur,AU,-33.494,151.051,AS13335 Cloudflare Inc,1.1.1.1

The KML output (resultados.kml) contains geographic placemarks that can be visualized in Google Earth or similar mapping software.

Usage Considerations

    The ipinfo API has usage limits (50,000 IPs per month for free accounts)
    The script is designed to handle cases where geolocation data cannot be obtained for certain IPs
    For detailed usage instructions, refer to Usage Guide

Summary

The Geolocation to CSV/KML system provides a streamlined workflow for:

    Converting IP addresses to geographic coordinates and location information
    Exporting the data in CSV format for analysis
    Generating KML files for visualization
    Processing multiple IP addresses efficiently
    Handling incremental updates to avoid duplicating work
